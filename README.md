# Summer 2024 Research Internship (Financial Sentiment Analysis)
Over the summer of 2024 I was a research intern for professor Kaamran at Penn State University, where I created a project that recommends buying stocks based off of sentiment analysis scores, historical data based on the stocks and returns.

NOTES FOR THE CODE:
1) Install these packages:
    pip install requests
    pip install pandas
    pip install finvizfinance
    pip install beautifulsoup4
    pip install transformers
    pip install torch
    pip install nltk
    pip install finvader
    pip install yfinance
    pip install scikit-learn
    pip install xgboost
    pip install lightgbm
    pip install catboost
    pip install tensorflow
2) If you encounter an error when running the code it will most likely be because of the API token. Because many interns are using the same finviz account the token is regenerated by others, so make sure you go to the finviz website, in the settings is an API section where you can get a token to input (UNLESS YOU HAVE YOUR OWN ACCOUNT, YOUR TOKEN WILL ALWAYS BE FINE).
3) After running the code you will have two files, one is the finviz screener and the other is "stock_news_today_with_sentiment_and_recommendations", which is the final product that has plenty of data in it, sentiment scores, overall sentiment, predicted return, and the recommendation. There is more in it but those are the most important.
